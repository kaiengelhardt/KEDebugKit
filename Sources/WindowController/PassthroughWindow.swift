		// `preferStatusBarHidden` and friends, is pretty lame. The view controller needs to be in the front most,
		// full-frame window which returns `true` from `_canAffectStatusBarAppearance`. "full-frame" in this context
		// means that the window has the same frame as its associated `UIWindowScene`. When adding auxiliary windows
		// on top of the main app window, this behavior is usually undesired.
		//
		// My original workaround for this was to set the frame of auxiliary windows to be 1 point less in height
		// than its `UIScreen`. Unfortunately this proved to be problematic, since now the auxiliary window was not
		// being resized properly, when putting the app into split-screen on the iPad. Scene frame changes are only
		// propagated for full-frame windows.
		//
		// The only viable workaround for now is to swizzle `_canAffectStatusBarAppearance` with an implementation that
		// returns `false`.
